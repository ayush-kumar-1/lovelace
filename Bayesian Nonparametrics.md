# Bayesian Nonparametric Statistics
There are 4 primary branches in statistics stemming from a combination of bayesian vs. frequentist and parametric vs. nonparametric. Frequentist statistic is what you're most likely taught in school - confidence intervals, hypothesis tests with p-values, and other inference models assuming that the true nature of the world is a fixed quantity to determine from observation. Bayesians believe the world to be everchanging and update their beliefs about the quantity in question as more information (data) becomes available. Parametric statistics is concerned with the study of models with fixed parameter values that are to be determined. Nonparameterics in contrast assumes that there are an infinite number of possible parameters that can take on almost any value that cannot be precisely determined. Frequentist and bayesian parametric statistics assume that the underlying truth is a function of a certain quantities i.e. the mean and the variance of a normal distribution. In the nonparametric world we make no such assumptions about the underlying distribution. While this generalization makes things more difficult, it oftentimes more accurately reflects the uncertainty in distributional qualities that real world data exhibits.
