# Comments & Recommendations from Jamell
Jamell is a fellow intern, and 4th year PhD student at MSU. We discussed my ambitions in data science and in the field of research, and he critiqued our project. Overall feedback: we have a solid kernel of an idea, and our results are promising, but our paper is very clearly novice and needs work. For a class project we did excellent (he said 16-17 out of 20), but we need to put in a great amount of work to bring it publishable quality. This process will most likely take many months, but with proper support and adequate effort, we should be able to publish. 

## Big Picture Feedback 
### Writing is Stylistically Fragmented and of Poor Quality 
Our writing was done for the most part within a matter of a few days, and it shows. It is apparent that there were 3 different authors on the paper, and it lacks stylistic cohesion. Our writing is at times overly descriptive, and at other times not descriptive enough. 

Much of our project was written in context of the requirements of the capstone project. We adhered to this well for our purposes, but in a research context we must improve the quality of the writing. 

When we submit to a workshop/conference/journal our paper will be reviewed by people who have studied the subject for 5 years, 10 years or even longer. If our information is not 100% correct, or there is room for doubt we place ourselves at high risk for rejection. We must have perfect confidence in our ideas, and convey them clearly and concisely.  

### Related Works Lacks Detail 
Our related works section is sparse, and lacks the necessary detail needed to effectively tell a story. Related works should be comprehensive review of the subject, its importance, and our inspiration for research. We should a minimum of 15+ citations in this section (we currently have 2). This should also be our starting point for improvement for a few key reasons
- related works forces you to review the current literature in depth around the subject 
- it allows for better contextualization of our contribution to the literature 

### Modeling 
Our modeling needs work. In essence we cannot use traditional

### Embedding and Classification Methods are Too Detailed
Understanding which details to include, and which ones to exclude is difficult, but it is dependent on the standards for the task that your are publishing. In the cyberbullying/nlp field we don't need to expand on BOW, or TF-IDF, and we can keep our descriptions of neural models to a minimum. Jamell proposed that we take our sections 5 and 6, combine them and lay them out as so...

5. Classification Methods
	5.1 -  Feature Extraction 
		5.1.1 - BOW
		5.1.2 - TF-IDF
	5.2 - Baseline models 
		5.2.1 - SVM or LR
		5.2.2 - XGBoost
	5.3 - Deep Learning Methods 
		5.3.1 - BERT 
		5.3.2 - DistilBERT 
		5.3.3 - RoBERTa
		5.3.4 - HateBERT
		5.3.5 - XLNet
