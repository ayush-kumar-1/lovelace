# Comments & Recommendations from Jamell
Jamell is a fellow intern, and 4th year PhD student at MSU. We discussed my ambitions in data science and in the field of research, and he critiqued our project. Overall feedback: we have a solid kernel of an idea, and our results are promising, but our paper is very clearly novice and needs work. For a class project we did excellent (he said 16-17 out of 20), but we need to put in a great amount of work to bring it publishable quality. This process will most likely take many months, but with proper support and adequate effort, we should be able to publish. 

## Big Picture Feedback 
1. Related Works Lacks Detail 

Our related works section is sparse, and lacks the necessary detail needed to effectively tell a story. Related works should be comprehensive review of the subject, its importance, and our inspiration for research. We should a minimum of 15+ citations in this section (we currently have 2). This should also be our starting point for improvement for a few key reasons
- related works forces you to review the current literature in depth around the subject
