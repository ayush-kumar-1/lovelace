# Great Expectations 

Webpage: [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/expectations)


Great Expectations is a shared, open standard for data quality. It helps data teams eliminate pipeline debt, through data testing, documentation, and profiling. An Expectation is a declarative statement that a computer can evaluate, and that is semantically meaningful to humans, like `expect_column_values_to_be_unique` or `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`. Expectations are implemented as classes that provide a rich interface to the rest of the library to support validation, profiling, and translation. Some Expectations are implemented in the core library. Many others are contributed by the community of data practitioners that bring their domain knowledge and share it as Expectations

If you don't see an Expectation you are looking for you can make it yourself and become a contributor to the project!
