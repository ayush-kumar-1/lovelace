# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
The KS-Test is built to detect the difference in distribution between two continuous distributions based on their CDF's. This can be two unknown samples (2-sample KS-Test) or a single unknown variable and a target distribution (i.e. normal, exponential, etc.) The KS test statistic can be calculated with 

$$D=\sup |P_1,n(x) - Q_2,m(x)|$$
The KS test statistic follows the Kolmogorov distribution.
