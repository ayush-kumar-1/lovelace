Ensuring the quality of data is key to ensuring model performance, preventing data drift, and creating interprebility. 

Data quality has come into the forefront of the machine learning world with the rise of the [data-centric ai](https://datacentricai.org/) movement. Some examples of data-centric AI includes: 
1. [[Data Augmentation]]
2. Technical Debt from Machine Learning
