# Cowardice is Not Risk Aversion
Humans on average are risk averse creatures. And the higher the stakes, the more we value the sure outcome. Let me offer you a simple coin toss for $10, if it comes back heads I'll give you $15 if it comes up tails I keep your money. Some people instantly reject this bet, some would take it almost by instinct. The statisticians might tell you that nobody should take the bet because the expected value is -$2.5. If we change the parameters of the bet to winning $20 or $25 the statisticians would become gamblers. Raise the stakes high enough though and everyone will walk away from the most statistically sound bet. Would you be willing to put $10,000 on the line for $25,000? How about your life savings on black at the roulette wheel? The stakes effect our decision making. Economists have neatly captured this idea with the "law" of diminishing marginal utility. The interactions between utility and stakes make accurate risk-taking hard even with perfect information, and the real world offers no such thing.
