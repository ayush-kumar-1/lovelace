# Overview 
Forecasting and time series modeling depend on a fundamental assumption that the dependent variable's value depends on  past values of the time series. If this assumption does not hold, the time series approach is fundamentally flawed. Stock movements, asset prices, and consumer behaviors are oftentimes products of the macroeconomic environment and future expectations for that environment.

The second fundamental assumption of time-series models is a stationary environment. This means an absence of black swan events both positive and negative. This assumption usually holds when forecasting natural phenomenon, but breaks down when predicting human behavior. Any time-series model that may have radical shifts should include additional scenario planning. 

Keeping in mind these two fundamental limitations time-series modeling may be appropriate. Many modern time-series frameworks automate feature engineering, but these fundamentals are key when off-the-shelf approaches fail.
