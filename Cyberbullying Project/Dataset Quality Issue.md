# Dataset Quality 
Cyberbully detection suffers from many dataset quality issues, the largest of which has traditionally been class imbalance. This problem is exacerbated when discussing the fine-grained problem. Wang et. al tried to address this problem by using a dynamic query expansion procedure, but upon close inspection this may only be a piecemeal solution due to lack of data diversity. Lack of diversity may led to detection systems that are not robust. Based on the Table 1 in Wang et. al the classes most prone to this lack of diversity may be age, ethnicity, and religion. A first step to addressing this issue is to track the [[data lineage]]. Table 1 details 6 sources of data. 

A next step would be to assess the diversity of the examples by source, and then of the aggregate dataset. Further analysis of data diversity should consider the diversity of DQE in comparison to the seed tweets. It is also d
