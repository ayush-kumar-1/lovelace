# Problem Statement 
Cyberbullying detection suffers from many dataset quality issues, the largest of which has traditionally been class imbalance. This problem is exacerbated when discussing the fine-grained problem. Wang et. al tried to address this problem by using a dynamic query expansion procedure, but upon close inspection this procedure has resulted in a large amount of tweets being mislabeled. Preliminary testing on the dataset reveals anywhere from 10-15% of all examples are labeled incorrectly.
