# Writing Related Works
Writing a good paper is difficult, and the introduction and related works sections are by far the most important. Since literature review is the first topic to cover, here are observations and tips (from previous literature) and online works. 

In the Related Works section, you should discuss briefly about published matter that technically _relates_ to your proposed work.

A short summary of what you can include (but not limited to) in the _Related Works_ section:

-   Work that proposes a different method to solve the same problem.
-   Work that uses the same proposed method to solve a different problem.
-   A method that is similar to your method that solves a relatively similar problem.
-   A discussion of a set of related problems that covers your problem domain.

## NJIT Literature Review Notes 
Step 1: Read a lot 
- start by reading broadly, there is no substitute for understanding and reading the surrounding literature 
- look carefully at references, and read the ones that make points that you may be interested in, then read the references for those articles 
- read from tangentially related fields. look in areas outside of computer science/ML/Stat
	For us this entails reading from sociology, psychology, and perhaps education papers 
- Use the 'cited by' features in databases where it is avialable
