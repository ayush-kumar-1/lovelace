# Learning with Noisy Labels 
Deep neural networks (DNN) have a tendency to memorize and overfit. Arpit. et. al showed that DNNs will first memorize general patterns, and only later overfit on noisy labels. [@arpitCloserLookMemorization2017]  Real world data is prone is noisy labels and requires approaches leverage large-scale noisy datasets. Waseem et. al showed that cyberbullying annotations can  suffer from biased label annotations. [@waseemAreYouRacist2016] Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is a recent topic in deep learning research that attempts to limit the effect of noisy labels. Most papers divide these into two approaches, sample selection and loss fn
