# Learning with Noisy Labels 
Deep neural networks (DNN) have a tendency to memorize and overfit on datasets. Arpit. et. al showed that DNNs will first memorize general patterns, and only later overfit on noisy labels.

Waseem et. al showed that cyberbullying annotations can often suffer from biased label annotations. [@waseemAreYouRacist2016]
